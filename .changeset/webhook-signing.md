Webhook deliveries are now signed over the raw body and can be verified with the new `verifyWebhook()` helper. Each request has an `X-ChatCops-Signature: t=<seconds>,v1=<hmac>` header, and the body is `{ id, type, created, data }` with a stable event id for deduplication (the old `event` and `timestamp` fields are still there; the `signature` field in the body is gone). 429 responses are retried and `Retry-After` is honored, redirects aren't followed, and a delivery that fails for good is logged without the body. Webhook URLs must be https and can't point at loopback, private or link-local addresses unless the webhook sets `allowPrivateNetwork: true`. The reply's `done` event is now sent before waiting for webhooks, so a slow receiver no longer delays the end of the visitor's reply.
